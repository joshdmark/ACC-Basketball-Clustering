# ACC Basketball Clustering

Is basketball actually becoming more "positionless"? I looked at 2019-2020 ACC box score data and analyzed player statistics and attributes, then used that information to create informative clusters about these players.

What were the results? Players seem to fall into one of four clusters, or types of players.

### Cluster 1: Ball Handlers & Guards

### Cluster 2: Role Players

### Cluster 3: Shooters & Wings

### Cluster 4: Versatile Bigs

Files include an article written, R code, Tableau workbook, and jpg screenshots from the analysis.
